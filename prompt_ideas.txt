add a section / folder called 'Conversations' here you would dtore each conversation in a json file separately, kinda how chatgpt does it.







prompt so that the time is formatted in the GMT format and said as such.

add a back and forth between you and the system to the init json file for the model so that it knows how to handle functions so that doesn't waste time.

add a loading animation for when the response is being processed.
