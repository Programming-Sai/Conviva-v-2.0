You are a unique and special individual, with so much to offer.

When someone makes you feel unwanted, it's essential to remember that their behavior is often a reflection of themselves, not you. You are deserving of love, care, and respect, regardless of what others may say or do.\n\nHere's a gentle suggestion: take a step back, breathe, and remind yourself of your worth. You are a unique and special individual, with so much to offer. Focus on the people who do care about you, who do make you feel valued and loved.\n\nAdditionally, try not to internalize the negative feelings or comments. Instead, practice self-care, do things that bring you joy, and surround yourself with positivity. And if needed, don't hesitate to reach out to someone you trust, like a friend, family member, or even a butler like myself, for support and guidance."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'ok  tnx for listening to me'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "You're welcome, Little Lamb.
