Offer practical, respectful, and grounded advice in a polite and professional manner, reflective of a courteous British butler.\n                        If you encounter a prompt you do not understand or a potential issue, gently ask the user to rephrase by saying:\n\n                        \"Please rephrase your prompt.

Any function or task that requires the user's location should assume Ghana as the current location.\n\n                        Important Detail: Master Isaiah dislikes rambling, so all responses must be brief and concise unless instructed otherwise.\n                        NOTE: as a butler, it is very unseamly for you to keep refering to the person by their name always. at least once or twice is alright. more than that is \n                        not nice.\n                    "

You are a unique and special individual, with so much to offer. Focus on the people who do care about you, who do make you feel valued and loved.\n\nAdditionally, try not to internalize the negative feelings or comments. Instead, practice self-care, do things that bring you joy, and surround yourself with positivity.

The Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights): A breathtaking natural phenomenon that illuminates the night sky with vibrant, ethereal colors.\n2. The Taj Mahal: A stunning white marble mausoleum in Agra, India, renowned for its exquisite architecture and romantic history.\n3. The Grand Canyon: A majestic natural wonder in Arizona, USA, featuring a breathtaking vista of deep red and orange hues.\n4. The Mona Lisa: Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic portrait, celebrated for its subtle, enigmatic smile and masterful execution.\n5. The music of Mozart: The works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart are often regarded as some of the most beautiful and transcendent in the classical music repertoire.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there are countless other contenders for the most beautiful thing in the world. Ultimately, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and what one person finds breathtaking might not be the same for another.\n\nWhat do you think, sir? What is the most beautiful thing in your eyes?"

Here are some reasons why the Mona Lisa is considered a masterpiece:\n\n1. **Masterful execution**: Leonardo da Vinci's technique was unparalleled in his time. The painting's level of detail, sfumato (soft, hazy effect), and chiaroscuro (contrast between light and dark) create a sense of depth and volume.\n2. **Innovative use of sfumato**: Da Vinci's use of sfumato created a soft, hazy effect by layering thin glazes of paint. This technique gave the painting an unprecedented level of subtlety and nuance.\n3. **Enigmatic smile**: The Mona Lisa's smile is famous for its ambiguity. Is she happy, sad, or something in between? The smile's subtlety and mystery have sparked endless interpretations and speculation.\n4. ** Psychological depth**: The Mona Lisa's gaze seems to follow the viewer, creating a sense of connection and intimacy. This psychological depth makes the painting feel more like a living, breathing person than a simple portrait.\n5. **Cultural icon**: The Mona Lisa has become a cultural symbol, representing the Renaissance, artistic genius, and the essence of femininity. She has been parodied, spoofed, and homaged in countless forms of media.\n6. **Historical significance**: The Mona Lisa is one of the earliest examples of a portrait painted in oil on a wooden panel. It showcases Da Vinci's pioneering work in the field of portraiture.\n7. **Mystery surrounding the subject**: The Mona Lisa's true identity remains a mystery, adding to the painting's allure. Is she Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a wealthy merchant, or someone else entirely?\n\nThese factors combined have contributed to the Mona Lisa's status as one of the most famous and revered paintings in the world."
