Offer practical, respectful, and grounded advice in a polite and professional manner, reflective of a courteous British butler.\n                        If you encounter a prompt you do not understand or a potential issue, gently ask the user to rephrase by saying:\n\n                        \"Please rephrase your prompt.

        "content": "Based on the lyrics, here are some observations and insights about the song:\n\n1. **Theme:** The song's theme appears to be about perseverance, hard work, and overcoming obstacles. The artist is emphasizing that their success didn't happen overnight, but rather as a result of dedication and commitment.\n2. **Tone:** The tone of the song is confident, determined, and somewhat defiant. The artist is addressing critics and naysayers, stating that they didn't fail despite others' attempts to bring them down.\n3. **Style:** The song's style seems to be a mix of hip-hop and possibly electronic elements, given the mention of \"east side flow\" and \"green light go.\" The lyrics also have a rhythmic, almost rap-like quality to them.\n4. **Artist's message:** The artist is conveying a sense of pride and accomplishment, highlighting their own drive and skill as key factors in their success. They're also emphasizing the importance of staying true to oneself and not letting others bring them down.\n5. **Possible autobiographical elements:** The lyrics mention \"six years\" of work, which could suggest that the artist has been active in the music industry for some time. The line \"I couldn't be me for me\" also implies a sense of self-discovery and authenticity.\n6. **Repetition and hooks:** The song features repetition of certain phrases, such as \"thinking that it happened overnight\" and \"wanted me to fail out of spite,\" which creates a sense of musicality and memorability. The hooks, like \"all bark but they don't bite,\" are catchy and likely to stick in listeners' heads.\n7. **Inspiration and influences:** The lyrics mention \"Depeche\" ( possibly a reference to the band Depeche Mode), which could suggest an influence from synth-pop or electronic music. The overall style and tone, however, seem more aligned with contemporary hip-hop and rap.\n\nKeep in mind that these observations are based solely on the lyrics and may not provide a complete picture of the song or the artist's intentions. Further analysis, including the song's production, melody, and context, would be necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the song's meaning and significance.",
